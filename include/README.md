# include/angelscript

This folder just contains a copy of the header files for each add on in the 
"add_on" folder found in the official AngelScript download. By copying it here,
we can use a nicer #include path in Marmalade projects.

e.g.

```
#include <angelscript.h>
#include <angelscript/add_on/scriptstdstring.h>
```
